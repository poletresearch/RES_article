File formats

== Source file:

1. The file should be in CSV format; true CSV (comma-separated), not
tab-separated.No thousand separators in numbers. All data series to be
fitted should be included in a single file; the **Country** column
should be used to code different data series (see below).

2. The file should contain at least three columns: **Country**,
**Year**, and **Value**.

- **Country** (text) can be used to code
countries, regions, states etc. It can also 	be used to code e.g.
energy source or scenario, since there are no special columns for these.
E.g. “DE.W” and “DE.S” for wind and solar in Germany respectively, or
“DE.2050” for a certain scenario. Note: it there's only one data series
in the file (e.g. a single source for a single country), you should
still have the column Country for the code to work.

- **Year** (number) – year or other time variable.

- **Value** (number) – values to be
fitted. 

3. There can be additional column **Total** (number) containing
some sort of the system size in the same units as Value (e.g. total
electricity supply as the system size for wind generation data, both in
GWh). If this column is present, G and L can also be expressed as % of
the system size. **Total** should be provided for all data points for
which **Value** is provided (otherwise problems may occur in
calculations).

4. Any other columns can be included in the file, but
they are ignored in the process of fitting.


== Output: a csv file in the same location as the source data file. The
same name with _fit added.

Columns in the file:

**Country** – country, region etc. (the same as in the source file)

**Fit** – fitted model (S - logistic, G - Gompertz)

**L** – growth ceiling (saturation level)

**L.Size** – L as % of the system size (Total) in TMax (or in the last
available year if the estimated TMax is after that year). Calculated
only if there is the Total column in the source data file AND "total <-
T" is specified in the *fitting.R* file.

**TMax** – maximum growth year.  The corresponding levels are L/2 for S;
L * 0.368 for G.

**K** – growth constant

**dT** – time to grow from 10% to 90% of the ceiling. Calculated only
for S and G (there are no ceilings for L and E)

**G** – maximum growth rate, i.e. growth rate at TMax.

**G.Size** – G as % of the system size at TMax (or in the last available
year if the estimated TMax is after that year). Calculated only if there
is the Total column in the source data file AND "total <- T" is
specified in the *fitting.R* file.

**Maturity** – % of the eventual saturation level achieved by the fitted
curve by the last available empirical year.

**RSS.Rel** – relative RSS (residual sum of squares). RSS is a measure
of goodness-of-fit (for different models fitting he same datasets,
smaller RSS means better fit). To calculate relative RSS, the smallest
RSS value across all models for a given country is identified and all
RSS values for this country are normalized to that value (divided by
it). E.g. if the RSS's are: S - 300, G - 450, RSS.Rel will be : S - 1, G
- 1.5, . This parameter is usually more informative that the "raw" RSS.

**Good** – 1 if the model was fitted successfully, 0 – it the algorithm
was unable to fit the given model to the data. If Good = 0, all fit
parameters are reported as 0.

**Future** – 1 if the estimated TMax is in the future (after the last
available empirical datapoint), 0 otherwise. Warning: growth rates 
cannot be reliably estimated when the inflection point is in the future.
